### Getting started with Codio

1. **Create an account**

    Cedarville students receive a discount for an account with Codio that will be active for one year. Watch for information from your professor for how to create your account.
    
2. **Join a course**

    An account with Codio gives you access to the Codio development platform for creating an project you'd like. But to gain access to specific course assignments you need to join the appropriate course through Codio. Watch for information from your professor in order to join the correct class.
    
3. **Complete course assignments**

    Once you've joined a course you'll see any available activities inside of that course in Codio. There will usually also be a link to activities directly inside Moodle as well. Simply click to enter such an assignment.
