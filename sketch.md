### Getting Started with Sketch

1. **Obtain a License**

    Sketch is available for you to use on all the lab computers in Tyler on Cedarville University campus. However, you must activate the license when you log on to one of the lab computers for the first time. Look for an announcement from your professor in Moodle that provides the license key you can use in the lab.
